# Randomly Colored Background
Description: This project is a mobile application that changes the background color to a randomly generated color when the user taps anywhere on the screen or rotates the device screen.

## Features

I have added some features to enhance the user experience, including:

- Using Provider as state management.
- Unit testing.
- Utilizing a Feature-first as project structure https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-project-structure/ .
- Implementing solid_lints, Firebase Crashlytics, and shared preferences.
- Generating the app icon using AI and adding a splash screen.
- Adding an animation when the text appears for the first time and changing the gradient text colors to match the background random color.

## Supported Devices and Languages

The application is supported on both Android and iOS devices and includes localization for English and Arabic languages.
